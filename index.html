            <p class="text-muted"> There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created every day, or in other words, a million raised to the power of five (Marr, 2018). As the amount of data in the world is growing rapidly, one may wonder where their personal data goes and who has the ability to access it. The infographic above breaks down a simple Google search, showcasing who and what can access their data.</p> <br/> <br/> </div>

            <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left">Google creates an advertisement profile based on your search history, location, and other components of your personal Google account (Burgess, 2018). This advertisement profile is then stored in an ad database where it can be sold to advertising agencies.

Your data is then used in services such as Google Analytics, to further analyze and predict patterns in your online behaviour.

A search on one website generates other related ads based on this initial search, which will likely appear on pages you later visit.

           <p class="text-muted" style="position: relative; top: 40px;"> It may be concerning that Google and other services know so much about you, yet, what is even more concerning is how far your data reaches due to the large number of people who access it. As the number of services that hold this data increase, so does the risk of a data breach.

 <h5 class="text-muted" style="text-align: left; padding: 15px;"> The companies we represent include Fairmont Hotels, Amazon, Shopify, Telus, and McKinsey. While our companies all operate in different industries, they have one thing in common – they all handle massive amounts of consumer data. As business becomes increasingly digitized and automated, the amount of personal data collected by businesses grows exponentially. It is our view that all businesses should prepare for this by planning data protection measures. Throughout this page, we aim to present informed arguments for why the time to implement data safeguards is now.

            <h4 class="service-heading">Big data</h4>
            <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left">Big data is here to stay; for context, annual spending on technology and services in this sector is estimated to be over US $48 billion in 2019 (Lee 293). Despite the growing potential of big data, the compound annual market growth rate for 2010-2019 is expected to be approximately 23.1% (Lee 293), many firms are not positioned to take full advantage of their existing data.  In a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Iron Mountain in 2015, just 4% of the 1800 American businesses, both small and large, were capable of fully exploiting the value of their data (Fleckenstein et al. 10).</p>

            <h4 class="service-heading">Data collection</h4>
            <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left">Data collection is increasingly more extensive and intensive, and therefore, so is the potential for exposure of personal and sensitive information. This requires that firms proactively address growing concerns from individuals and governments regarding data privacy and security (Lee 301). One example of the lack of trust surrounding data privacy is the result of the 2015 TRUSTe Internet of Things Privacy Index which states that, “only 20% of online users believe that the benefits of smart devices outweighed any privacy concerns” (Lee 301).

            <h4 class="service-heading">Strategy</h4>
            <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left">Adopting a comprehensive big data strategy that prioritizes privacy and security can help protect good will and brand image (Lee 301); failing to do so can lead to breaches that could cost the firm directly, through fines, legal fees, and damages, as a well as indirectly through lost revenues and consumer trust (Alharthi et al 290, 291; Lee 301). Taking more deliberate action to improve best practices in the private sector, as well as government policy, toward data privacy and security, ultimately, ensures that firms and individuals can both benefit from the existing and future potential value of big data.

            <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left; position: relative; top: -20px;"> When the EU officially adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws on May 25, 2018, they were the result of nearly a decade of revisions (Bremmer, 2018). A review of Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics was published on February 28, 2018 (Krashinsky Robertson, 2018) and urged that Canada make preparations to strengthen privacy legislation in response to the EU’s GDPR. Action needs to be taken as soon as possible, given that pushing new legislation is such a lengthy process. Countries outside of the EU have less than four years before their privacy laws are assessed for adequacy status, which is required to do any business involving personal data transfer (Morgan, Gillis, & Thompson, 2018). Canada has had adequacy status since 2001 but may lose it without revisions to PIPEDA (Morgan et al., 2018).</p>

  <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left; position: relative; top: -20px;">Below is a table outlining some high-level differences between Canada’s current legislation in PIPEDA and the EU’s GDPR. The following information summarizes key points from an article provided by Bennett Jones LLP and written by Gittens, Burns, Kratz, and de Ridder (2018).  </p> <br/> <br/>

            <p style="text-align: left;" class="large text-muted">We believe that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) should start adopting policies sooner rather than later in preparation for the EU’s next assessment of our privacy legislation. Morgan, Gillis, and Thompson identified five key differences between PIPEDA and GDPR, which include the explicit right to erasure, data protection by design principle, and differences in enforcement powers (2018). Our proposal is that the OPC take small, gradual steps to adopt GDPR regulations rather than release a wave of changes to make the transition smoother and to give business adequate time to adjust policies. However, it may be advantageous for Canada to consider the broader aspects of future data privacy needs, and not just try to copy the GDPR (Morgan et al., 2018). In the near future, should an international governmental forum be created to address data privacy concerns, Canada should participate and work with other countries to create strong protections. </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;" class="large text-muted">In particular, we would like to see the right to erasure as well as the size of fines amended. Giving users the right to erasure would protect them against unwanted or unintentional breaches of their privacy once they have withdrawn their consent for data collection or terminate an online account. Making fines substantial would provide more of an incentive for businesses to take care in designing data safeguards. </p>

 <h3 style="color: white;">Suggestions for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner </h3> <br/>
<strong>Current Regulations in Canada</strong>
<p style="text-align: left; color: white;">The regulations regarding data protection and privacy in Canada are currently insufficient to manage the growing influence of data in today’s business environment. They lack outlines that promote the prevention of data breaches and mostly focus on the reporting of breaches. This goes against the overall goal of protecting users’ data as it does not encourage these companies to allocate resources to averting these breaches from happening in the first-place. Furthermore, allowing companies to handle their reporting internally causes a lack of proper monitoring and provides opportunity for them to disregard or modify details of breaches. To magnify this, the use of unclearly defined phrases such as “real risk” and “as soon as feasible” presents a grey area where compliance with these guidelines is left to conditional judgement. </p>
<strong> Our Suggestions </strong>
<p style="text-align: left; color: white;">We are advocating for Canada to implement a mandatory external auditing system that monitors companies’ data privacy and protection practices. These regulations should provide clear guidelines with specific timelines, unambiguous definitions, and definite consequences. We believe that introducing such as system will have many benefits for both companies and consumers. <br/><br/>
Having a mandatory external system in-place will promote awareness of data privacy issues. It will also allow companies to satisfy consumers’ increasing demand for secure data protection practices. It will also ensure that businesses can be trusted with consumers’ data and obscurity in how the data is being treated will be eliminated. Further, being externally evaluated encourages businesses to keep-up with an industry standard and prevents opportunities for cheating in data protocols. Ultimately, this system provides full-clarity for the consumer and pushes businesses to invest in developing strong data protection systems.  </p>
